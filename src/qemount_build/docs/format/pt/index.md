# Partition Tables

* 🔪 slicing up disks

You could fill your entire [disk](disk) with one [filesystem](fs), but you
probably don't want to. Generally, you chop it up, or partition it. To do this,
you need a scheme that says where the partitions are, how big they are and what
sort of thing they are. This is a partition table, and they have names.
