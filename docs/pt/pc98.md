# PC-98 Partition Table

PC-98 is the partitioning scheme used by NEC's PC-9800 series,
which dominated the Japanese market from the 1980s until the late 1990s.

## Characteristics

- Similar to MBR but different structure
- Up to 16 partitions
- Common in Japan only
- Little-endian format
- Boot sector differences from IBM PC

## Structure

PC-98 partition information is stored differently from IBM MBR:

**Sector 0 (IPL)**
```
Offset  Size  Description
0       2     Jump instruction
2       6     Reserved
...
```

**Partition Table (at sector 1+)**
```
Each entry typically 32 bytes
- Boot flag
- System ID
- Start CHS
- End CHS
- Name (Japanese)
```

## Partition Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 01 | FAT12 |
| 11 | FAT16 |
| 21 | FAT16 (>32MB) |
| 61 | FAT16 (>32MB, LBA) |
| 28 | Windows NT |
| 44 | FreeBSD |
| 62 | Linux |

## Historical Context

NEC PC-98 series was the dominant PC architecture in Japan,
incompatible with IBM PC. It used different:
- Memory addressing
- Graphics
- Disk partitioning

The format persisted even as PC-98 adopted DOS/Windows.

## Linux Support

Linux kernel has PC-98 partition support (CONFIG_NEC98_PARTITION).
Requires special kernel configuration, not commonly enabled.

## QEMU Notes

QEMU has experimental PC-98 machine emulation (pc98).
Not commonly used outside Japanese retro computing.
