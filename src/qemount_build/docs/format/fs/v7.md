# V7 Unix Filesystem

Created at Bell Labs for the PDP-11 in 1979 and released with V7 Unix, this is
the ancestor of most modern Unix filesystems.

## Characteristics:

- 14 character filename limit - hardcoded in the directory entry structure
- No symbolic links - those came with 4.2BSD in 1983
- 16-bit inodes - max ~65k files
- Block size: 512 bytes (fixed)
- Max filesystem size: ~1GB (24-bit block addresses * 512-byte blocks)
- Simple free list - not a bitmap, just a linked list of free blocks

## Structure

- Superblock at block 1
- Inodes start at block 2
- Very simple on-disk format - easy to understand
