# PC-98 Partition Table

PC-98 is the partitioning scheme used by NEC's PC-9800 series,
which dominated the Japanese market from the 1980s until the late 1990s.

## Characteristics

- Up to 16 partitions
- Little-endian format
- CHS addressing (8 heads, 17 sectors/track typical)
- Magic 0xAA55 at offset 510
- Partition table at sector 1

## Structure

**Sector 0 (Boot Code)**
```
Offset  Size  Description
0       510   Boot code (may contain "IPL1", "Linux 98", or "GRUB/98")
510     2     Magic (0xAA55)
```

**Partition Table (sector 1, offset 512)**
16 entries × 32 bytes = 512 bytes

**Partition Entry (32 bytes)**
```
Offset  Size  Description
0       1     MID (bit 7=bootable, bits 6-0=type)
1       1     SID (bit 7=active, bits 6-0=subtype)
2       2     Reserved
4       1     IPL sector
5       1     IPL head
6       2     IPL cylinder (le16)
8       1     Start sector (1-indexed)
9       1     Start head
10      2     Start cylinder (le16)
12      1     End sector
13      1     End head
14      2     End cylinder (le16)
16      16    Partition name
```

## Partition Types (MID)

| Type | Description        |
|------|--------------------|
| 0x01 | FAT12              |
| 0x11 | FAT16              |
| 0x21 | FAT16 (>32MB)      |
| 0x28 | Windows NT         |
| 0x44 | FreeBSD            |
| 0x61 | FAT16 (LBA)        |
| 0x62 | Linux              |

## CHS to LBA Conversion

PC-98 uses 0-indexed sectors (unlike standard CHS which is 1-indexed):

```
start_sect = (Cylinder × Heads + Head) × SectorsPerTrack + Sector
end_sect = (EndCylinder + 1) × Heads × SectorsPerTrack
size = end_sect - start_sect
```

Common PC-98 geometry: 8 heads, 16 sectors per track.

## Historical Context

NEC PC-98 series was the dominant PC architecture in Japan,
incompatible with IBM PC. It used different memory addressing,
graphics, and disk partitioning. The format persisted even as
PC-98 adopted DOS/Windows.
