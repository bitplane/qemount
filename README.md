# qemount

Let's mount everything/anything using qemu, by exposing it over 9p or other
transport. Spin up a tiny VM that provides access to an image, one instance per mount.

* Have the ability to use kernel mounts in FUSE
* Run ancient Linux kernels that still had write access to now read-only filesystems
* Run old operating systems (Amiga, Acorn) with any CPU arch, and read/write their
  filesystems
* ... basically a clutch between any image/block device, URL, file and anything else,
  the UNIX way - everything is a file.

## STATUS

0. unstable / pre-alpha

### plan

#### 0 Prove it works

- [x] prove it can be done and actually works
- [x] make a build system that isn't shit
- [x] get a working guest
  - [x] kernel + busybox image
  - [x] 9p server
- [ ] make FUSE reference client
  - [x] 9p client
  - [ ] wrapper script

#### 1 make it go

- [ ] untangle it
  - [x] fix testdata structure
  - [x] 9p server -> separate project
  - [ ] builder -> pypi package
  - [ ] rename clients to hosts
- [ ] build it
  - [ ] get it building on aarch64
  - [ ] cross compiling back and forth
- [ ] install it
  - [ ] write an installer
  - [ ] xdg launcher

#### 2 polish the turd

- [ ] safety
  - [ ] mount read only by default
  - [ ] make a test framework
  - [ ] data for every supported filesystem
- [ ] fix bugs
  - [ ] simple9p
    - [ ] spam in file browser
  - [ ] fuse
    - [ ] block size wrong for `du`
  - [ ] build
    - [ ] touch dockerfiles when deps change
    - [ ] don't build targets unless they're needed

### 3 go forth and multiply

- [ ] sshfs option
- ... add stuff that looks interesting
